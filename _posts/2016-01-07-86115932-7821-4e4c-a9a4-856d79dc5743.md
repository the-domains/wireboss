##### WHAT TO ENTER

The Nature Conservancy is committed to a New Wild---a future for people and nature---and we want to see it through your eyes. For our 2015 Photo Contest, we'd like to know: "what does the 'New Wild' mean to you?" Is it nature in an urban area? Is it in the forest and parks in your area? Does it have people in it, animals, or macro details in it? How do you live nature? Capture those vibrant moments that express what the New Wild means to you.

To ensure eligibility for the contest all entries must have a resolution of 6 million pixels or greater (6 megapixels) to be made available upon request. Please only submit web resolution files at the time of entry. Higher resolution files of 6 million pixels or greater (6 megapixels) will only be requested should an entry be preselected to be awarded a prize or an honorable mention. All photographs should accurately reflect the subject matter and the scene as it appeared. Photos that have been digitally altered beyond standard optimization (removal of dust, cropping, reasonable adjustments to exposure, color and contrast, etc.) will be disqualified.

Entries may originate in any format --- including, but not limited to digital files, digital prints, color transparencies, color prints, or black and white prints --- so long as they are submitted electronically in a .jpeg, .jpg or .gif format. Multiple exposures that have been combined to produce a single "High Dynamic Range" image are acceptable.

Previously published material for which non-exclusive rights were granted may be entered as long as you still maintain the right to grant us a license (see "Your Rights" below). You must be able to disclose when and where the photo appeared previously to The Nature Conservancy upon request.
